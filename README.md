# üõ†Ô∏è Business Task
As a Data Analyst at Podha, the company is facing a budget crunch and needs to optimize its marketing strategy. The company aims to focus on one marketing campaign, but to make this decision, we must first understand product performance, customer behavior, and overall profitability.
Objective: The goal of this analysis is to identify the most profitable products, the most valuable customers, and the effectiveness of campaigns to determine the best course of action for Podha‚Äôs marketing spend.

## Data Overview
**Data Source:** The data includes *customer transactions*, *campaign performance*, and *product information*.

**Data Structure:** The data is stored in a SQL database, requiring some cleaning (e.g., converting text to dates, removing duplicates) for analysis.

# ‚ÅâÔ∏è Analysis
**Product Performance & Profitability:**
Determine which products generate the highest profit margins and sales volume.

**Customer Performance:** 
Identify the highest-spending customer segments and those with the most frequent orders.

**Campaign Effectiveness:**
Determine which campaigns bring in the most revenue, provide the best return on investment (ROI) and determine budget allocation for each.

# üìÖ SQL Techniques Used

The code_base folder contains all SQL queries, data processing scripts, and analysis steps.
