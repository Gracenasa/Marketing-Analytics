## Dashboard Overview
This dashboard offers real-time insights by ensuring that any modifications made are directly reflected in our dashboard. 
DirectQuery allows us to connect to our data source in real-time, eliminating the need for manual data imports or refresh schedules. With real-time data access, you can:
1. Make timely decisions based on the latest information.
2. Ensure data consistency by working directly with live data without any intermediary steps.
3. Avoid data redundancy by connecting to the source directly and retrieving only what's necessary.
